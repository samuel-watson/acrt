\usage{
compute_sample_size(
  results,

  hypothesis = c("H1", "H0"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Output from find_lambda_for_power or adaptive_trial_analysis}

\item{sample_size_fn}{Function that computes sample sizes.
Signature: function(opt_designs, stage1_info, ...) -> list with:
- n_stage1: Scalar or vector of stage 1 sample sizes
- n_stage2: Vector of stage 2 sample sizes for each z1 point
- metrics: Named list of additional metrics to report (e.g., max_n2, E_clusters)}

\item{hypothesis}{"H1" (default) or "H0" - determines z1 distribution}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to sample_size_fn}
