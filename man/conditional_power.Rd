\title{Model functions must return a list with at minimum:
\itemize{
\item I1_eff: Stage 1 efficient information (scalar)
\item I2_eff: Stage 2 conditional efficient information (scalar)
\item I_eff: Total efficient information (scalar)
\item w1, w2: Combination weights
\item b1: Treatment effect (delta) for power calculations
}}
\usage{
conditional_power(z1, I2_eff, w1, w2, delta)
}
\arguments{
\item{z1}{Stage 1 z-statistic}

\item{I2_eff}{Stage 2 conditional efficient information}

\item{w1, }{w2 Combination weights}

\item{delta}{Effect size on linear predictor scale}
}
\description{
Additional fields can be included for:
\itemize{
\item Resource tracking (n1, n2, k1, k2, etc.)
\item Cost calculation (any fields used by cost_fn)
\item Sample size computation (any fields used by sample_size_fn)
}
}
\details{
The function signature should be: function(design_params, fixed_params)
where design_params is a single row from the design grid.
Conditional power (two-sided)
